Node.js = v18+

Project Setup:
  cd RFP-FE
  npm i 
  create .env
  npm run dev

Tech Stack & Key libraries:
  React + ts 
  Tailwindcss
  Axios
  zod
  react-hot-toast

Key Decisions:
  - I decided to make a dashboard to view all details about the actions perform on the platform.
  - Instead of writing query to put enter vendors into DB. I made UI to add vendors, so its super simple and easy now.
